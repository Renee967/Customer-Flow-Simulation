# Customer-Flow-Simulation

Part (1): 
In this program, you are going to write a program to simulate the customer flows in the supermarket. The following is the function prototype which is given:

int act(int type, int NumCustomers);

This function will do the following jobs:
if act is called with type=1, print out “a custom enters the supermarket”, NumCustomers++, return NumCustomers;
if act is called with type=-1, that means a custom left the supermarket, if there are still customers in the supermarket, do: NumCustomers--; otherwise, print out “No Customers”; return NumCustomers
